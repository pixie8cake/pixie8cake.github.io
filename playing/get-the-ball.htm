    <p>You decide to get the ball, sure, you have five others, but this one was special, you had grown attached to it in
      the half hour you had been using it.</p>
      
    <p>You walk over to the mansion. There's a fence around it. It's tall, but the design of it makes it easy to climb. 
      You notice that a part of the fence is broken on at the bottem, so you could also crawl under it.</p>
      
      <p>Do you want to go over the fence or under the fence?</p>
