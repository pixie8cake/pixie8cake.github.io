      <p>You flip the switch and something lights up above you.</p>
      
      <P>It's a light-up ghost halloween decoration. "Boo" is written above it in flashing lights.</P>
      
      <P>You were right, this house is trying to hard.</P>
      
      <P>You briefly wonder why the switch is outside, but you figure it doesn't matter.</P>
      
      <P>You decide to look around for an entrance.</P>
      
      <P>There's a broken window to the left of the door and unlocked cellar doors around the side.</P>
