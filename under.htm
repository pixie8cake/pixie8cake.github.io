      <p>You crawl under the fence. You get covered in mud, but other than that it goes well.</p>

      <P>You walk though the garden. It's filled with dead trees and even some gravestones. it almost looks like
        it's trying to hard to be scary.</P>
      
      <P>As you approach the door to the mansion you hear chains rattling and thunder, which is weird, since it's sunny today.</P>
